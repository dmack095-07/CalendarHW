# CalendarHW
Homework 5

I created a functional calender for Homework 5. When you open the webpage the calender is set for business hours. At the top of the webpage is the current day and time. Each hour is color coded depending on the time. The timeblock is represented by color: grey for past, red for present, and green for future. When you click on the textbox for each hour you can save your input. Once the input is stored and saved, you can then refresh the page and the input stays.
